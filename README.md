An effective convolutional neural network for visualized understanding transboundary air pollution based on Himawari-8 satellite images
Air pollution is a societal and cross-boundary en- vironmental problem that can be visualized using satellite. A satellite imaging is not only useful to the home country but also to the neighboring countries. Moreover, monitoring the movement of air pollution can help susceptible people avoid acid rain and photochemical smog. Using advanced remote sensing (RS) images, we can obtain substantial information, which can produce numerous effective methods for visualizing air pollution. In this study, we propose a novel method for extracting air pollution. Additionally, we present this novel training procedure by applying various pipeline networks, including surface feature regions (focus area method) based on each convolution to exploit the spectral aspect information. Afterward, we extract three indexes with numerous modified fully convolutional networks (FCNs). Then, by employing a multi-vote module, we visualize air pollution. In the conducted experiments, we utilized five years Himawari-8 satellite images in the Northâ€“East Asia area to validate the aforementioned frameworks.
